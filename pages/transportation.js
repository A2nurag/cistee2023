            <p className='my-3 md:ml-6'>
              Durgapur is surrounded by Asansol subdivision on the west,

              Damodar River) in the south and Birbhum district (across Ajay

            </p>

            <p className='my-3 md:ml-6'>
              Durgapur has a transitional climate. The place is located at an
              elevation of about 65 m above sea level. Durgapur, much like the
              other parts of West Bengal, experiences three distinct seasons -
              summer, monsoon and winter. While summers may be extremely hot,
              winter are characterized by pleasant and cool temperatures.
            </p>

            <h4 className='text-2xl my-3 font-bold'>Summer</h4>
            <p className='my-3 md:ml-6'>
              The summer season in Durgapur is characterized by excessive heat.
              Mercury rises phenomenally, with a record of reaching even 45 째C
              mark. However, the average summer temperature lies somewhere
              between 28째C and 35째C. Humidity in the region is also high, as it
              is close to the Damodar River and Ajay River.
            </p>

            <h4 className='text-2xl my-3 font-bold'>Monsoon</h4>
            <p className='my-3 md:ml-6'>
              The arrival of July marks the onset of monsoon in Durgapur. Light
              showers in the initial days give way to heavy downpour. The
              average rainfall is about 150 millimeters, with the bulk occurring
              in the July-September period. The rest of the year is pretty dry,
              with little or almost no rainfall. The months from March to May
              are extremely dry. During monsoon, do not forget to carry
              umbrellas and raincoats.
            </p>

            <h4 className='text-2xl my-3 font-bold'>Winter</h4>
            <p className='my-3 md:ml-6'>
              Winters are marked by a pleasant and cool environment. The
              scorching heat of the area gives way to a more pleasing and
              satisfying stay. The minimum average temperature during the winter
              months goes down to about 10 째C. The level of humidity is
              extremely low in the cold season. It is also the best time to
              visit Durgapur, as travellers would experience a pleasant climate,
              devoid of both sunny scorching heat and heavy monsoons. Suitable
              winter clothings are required.
